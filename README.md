1. Finished a function to send api, so saving apis in a proper format. (e.g. saveing it after ParseBody().)
2. Why /index.php in PathsApi.txt list? Do I need to care about this?
    - No rings can appear
    - There are some problems in PathsApi, It'll save a api which is not belong to the specific url.
